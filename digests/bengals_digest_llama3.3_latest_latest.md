> The Bengals' 2025 schedule has been released, featuring a season opener in Cleveland, a Thanksgiving night matchup against the Ravens, and a favorable bye week, but also a brutal three-week stretch in Weeks 13-15 that includes two games against the Ravens and a trip to Buffalo. The team will host only one primetime game at Paycor Stadium, a Thursday Night Football contest, which is a continuing source of frustration for fans who feel the NFL doesn't give the Bengals enough respect on national television, despite having marketable players like Joe Burrow.

> The Bengals are set to face the Ravens on Thanksgiving in Baltimore, marking their fourth straight season playing a primetime game in Charm City and their third consecutive Thursday night matchup at M&T Bank Stadium, a scheduling quirk that may indicate the NFL views the Bengals as a marquee opponent for other teams' showcase games. While some fans may grumble about the repeat engagement, the team's overall schedule can be seen as a "prove-it" slate, with opportunities to win multiple road primetime games and potentially earn more flexed games later in the season, including matchups against Arizona, Cleveland, and Baltimore.

> The Cincinnati Bengals' 2025 schedule is shaping up to be a primetime showcase, with four currently scheduled night games, including a Monday Night Football rematch against the Denver Broncos in Week 4 and a Thanksgiving Night showdown against the Baltimore Ravens in Week 13. With Joe Burrow and company set to face off against top quarterbacks like Lamar Jackson and Tua Tagovailoa under the lights, the Bengals' playoff seeding could be significantly impacted by these high-stakes matchups, which may not be the only primetime games on their schedule if the NFL's Flex Scheduling intervenes.

> The Bengals are set to open the 2025 season as 5.5-point favorites against their division rival Cleveland Browns, a team plagued by question marks, including a quarterback uncertainty, and closer to rebuilding than contending for the AFC North. With a history of slow starts under Zac Taylor, the Bengals will look to buck that trend and start strong, but they shouldn't expect an easy win in the notoriously brutal Battle of Ohio, where a Week 1 victory would be a crucial step towards a potential championship push.
