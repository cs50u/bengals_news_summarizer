> The Bengals are set to face the Ravens on Thanksgiving, marking their fourth consecutive season playing in Baltimore on primetime, which might be a sign of the NFL viewing them as a marquee matchup. This scheduling also puts the Bengals in a position to prove themselves, especially after underperforming last season with a 9-8 record, and they'll have limited opportunities to shine at home with only one primetime and one late-afternoon game on the schedule.

> The Cincinnati Bengals are set to play four prime-time games in 2025, with matchups against the Denver Broncos, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Baltimore Ravens getting the spotlight. The schedule has the Bengals facing the Broncos on Monday Night Football in Week 4, a rematch of last season's thriller, and a short-week Thursday Night Football showdown with the Steelers in Week 7, which could be a challenge for Joe Burrow and company against a tough Pittsburgh defense.

> The Bengals' 2025 schedule is out, and it's a mixed bag - they'll open on the road against the Browns, but get a winnable home game against the Jaguars in Week 2. Contract drama might be brewing with Trey Hendrickson's status uncertain, and the team will have to navigate a tough Thanksgiving matchup against the Ravens, but they'll get a bye week to regroup; injuries and rumors will surely play a role, but for now, the focus is on the 17-week grind ahead.
