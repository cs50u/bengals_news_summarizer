### [Bengals cutting ties with Trey Hendrickson suggested for replacement from entirely different sport](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/cincinnati-bengals/news/bengals-cutting-trey-hendrickson-replacement-different-sport/fb00043ed7ff0bef4476cd60)

> No actual news here, just a weird hypothetical from a Cleveland broadcast crew. The idea: the Bengals could replace Trey Hendrickson with a relief pitcher from the Reds, Tony Santillan. The "proposal" came from the Guardians' trio of Matt Underwood, Rick Manning, and Andre Knott. Santillan, listed at 6'3", 285 lbs, has the size for a defensive end, but there's zero chance this happens. The Bengals aren't cutting ties with Hendrickson, and Santillan is a baseball player. Just a fun, wild idea with no basis in reality.

The Bengals schedule release video dropped, and it's got everyone talking. The team roasted their 2025 opponents with some hilarious one-liners hidden in the video. On the serious side, center Ted Karras is pumped about the schedule, calling it "advantageous" with a Week 10 bye that he thinks is "perfect".

Off the field, there's drama around the team's stadium situation. Hamilton County is frustrated with negotiations, and it seems the Bengals aren't exactly cooperative. The county's terminated its agreement with one of its lawyers, and it's unclear how this will impact talks.

In other news, former Bengals defensive end Sam Hubbard hosted a charitable Fowling Tournament, bringing in teammates like Ted Karras and Trey Hendrickson. 

The team's got a tough road ahead, with not one, not two, but three primetime road games in Baltimore - and it's four straight years, no less. We'll see how that plays out.

This development comes as the county and team are working to finalize a new lease agreement, with a looming deadline just a month and a half away.
