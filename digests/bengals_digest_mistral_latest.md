> 2025 schedule analysis: The Bengals kick off against Cleveland in Week 1 before hosting the Jaguars; three primetime road games, including Thanksgiving versus Baltimore. A difficult three-week stretch (Weeks 13-15) includes two matchups with the Ravens and a trip to Buffalo. Paycor Stadium gets one primetime home game, yet the team will play only once on Sunday Night Football. The schedule's uneven distribution of primetime games for Cincinnati is questionable.

> The Cincinnati Bengals will be playing the Baltimore Ravens for the fourth consecutive season on primetime, this time on Thanksgiving. Despite some frustration over playing in Baltimore so frequently, the NFL seems to view these games as prime-time or holiday events, providing the Bengals an opportunity to prove themselves with three potential road primetime wins this season against teams like Denver and Miami. The Bengals' schedule appears to be a challenge, testing their mettle after underperforming last year at 9-8, with only one home primetime game and one home 4:25 FOX game. Games against Arizona, Cleveland, and even Baltimore could potentially get flexed, presenting additional opportunities for the Bengals to cement their status in primetime.

> 2025 sees the Cincinnati Bengals playing four primetime games: Week 4 against Denver Broncos (MNF), Week 7 vs. Pittsburgh Steelers (TNF), Week 13 at Baltimore Ravens (Thanksgiving NF), and Week 16 at Miami Dolphins (SNF). The schedule makers seem to enjoy setting up Burrow-led offenses for high-stakes Monday Night Football rematches, with a potential playoff seeding battle against Denver in week 4. The Bengals will face divisional rivals on both TNF and SNF, with Thursday's game against Pittsburgh potentially testing their mettle on a short week. The Thanksgiving matchup against Baltimore could replicate the fireworks of last season, while the finale against Miami features two top-drafted QBs from 2020 in another prime time showdown. Flex scheduling leaves room for more primetime games as weeks 17 and 18 contests against Arizona Cardinals and Cleveland Browns remain undecided.
